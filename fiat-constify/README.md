Postprocessor for [fiat-crypto] generated field implementations which rewrites
them as `const fn`.

[Documentation][docs-link]

## About

This crate is a workaround for [mit-plv/fiat-crypto#1086] which provides a
mechanical postprocessing step for [fiat-crypto] generated field
implementations.

It removes `&mut` references which aren't yet stable with `const fn`, instead
allocating and returning an array on the stack for results.
