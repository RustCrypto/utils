//! # zeroize_stack
//!
//! A crate for sanitizing stack memory after sensitive operationsâ€”sometimes referred to as _Stack Bleaching_.
//!
//! Modern compilers and CPUs routinely copy, spill, and rearrange data during execution. Even if sensitive values are scoped to a function, they may:
//! - Be duplicated across multiple stack frames
//! - Be spilled from registers to the stack during register pressure
//! - Persist in memory long after the function returns
//!
//! This crate provides tools to explicitly zeroize stack regions used during
//! cryptographic or sensitive computations, helping mitigate:
//! - Leakage through stack inspection or memory dumps
//! - Residual data from compiler-inserted spills
//! - ABI-visible register reuse across function boundaries
//!
//! ## Why Stack Sanitization Matters
//!
//! Unlike heap memory, stack allocations are ephemeral and compiler-controlled.
//! Sensitive data may be:
//! - Copied implicitly by the optimizer
//! - Stored temporarily during register allocation
//! - Left behind in stack frames even after function return
//!
//! This crate offers abstractions for:
//! - Executing functions on isolated, aligned stack buffers
//! - Zeroizing stack memory after execution
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! These operations involve low-level stack manipulation and unsafe code. The
//! caller must ensure:
//! - The stack size provided is large enough for the closure to run with.
//! - The closure does not unwind or return control flow by any means other than
//! directly returning.
//!
//! ## Use Cases
//!
//! - Cryptographic routines
//! - Secure enclave transitions
//! - Sanitizing temporary buffers in high-assurance systems

/// Executes a function/closure and clears the function's stack by using
/// preallocated space on the heap as the function's stack, and then zeroing
/// that allocated space once the code has ran.
///
/// This function does not clear the CPU registers.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `stack_size_kb` - how large the stack will be. `psm` recommends at least
/// `4 KB` of stack size, but the total size cannot overflow an `isize`. Also,
/// some architectures might consume more memory in the stack, such as SPARC.
/// * `crypto_fn` - the code to run while on the separate stack.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// * `crypto_fn` should be marked as `#[inline(never)]`, preventing register
/// reuse and stack layout changes.
/// * The stack needs to be large enough for `crypto_fn()` to execute without
/// overflow.
/// * `crypto_fn()` must not unwind or return control flow by any other means
/// than by directly returning.
