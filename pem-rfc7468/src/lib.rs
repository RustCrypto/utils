//! Pure Rust implementation of PEM Encoding ([RFC 7468]) for PKIX, PKCS, and
//! CMS Structures, a strict subset of the original Privacy-Enhanced Mail encoding
//! intended  specifically for use with cryptographic keys, certificates, and other
//! messages.
//!
//! Provides a `no_std`-friendly, constant-time implementation suitable for use with
//! cryptographic private keys.
//!
//! # About
//!
//! Many cryptography-related document formats, such as certificates (PKIX),
//! private and public keys/keypairs (PKCS), and other cryptographic messages (CMS)
//! provide an ASCII encoding which can be traced back to Privacy-Enhanced Mail
//! (PEM) as defined in [RFC 1421], which look like the following:
//!
//! ```text
//! -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
//! MC4CAQAwBQYDK2VwBCIEIBftnHPp22SewYmmEoMcX8VwI4IHwaqd+9LFPj/15eqF
//! -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
//! ```
//!
//! However, all of these formats actually implement a text-based encoding that is
//! similar to, but *not* identical with, the legacy PEM encoding as described in
//! [RFC 1421].
//!
//! For this reason, [RFC 7468] was created to describe a stricter form of
//! "PEM encoding" for use in these applications which codifies the previously
//! de facto rules that most implementations operate by, and makes recommendations
//! to promote interoperability.
//!
//! This crate attempts to implement a strict interpretation of the [RFC 7468]
//! rules, implementing all of the MUSTs and SHOULDs while avoiding the MAYs,
//! and targeting the "ABNF (Strict)" subset of the grammar as described in
//! [RFC 7468 Section 3 Figure 3 (p6)][RFC 7468 p6].
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! The implementation of this crate takes great care to operate in
//! constant-time whenever possible by avoiding branching on any values which
//! may contain secret data.
//!
//! It uses the [`base64ct`] crate for Base64 decoding/encoding, which provides
//! a portable constant-time implementation of the Base64 format.
//!
//! The implementation also avoids heap allocations by default, allowing it to
//! work in "heapless" `no_std` environments.
//!
//! # Minimum Supported Rust Version
//!
//! This crate requires **Rust 1.51** at a minimum.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! # #[cfg(feature = "alloc")]
//! # {
//! /// Example PEM document
